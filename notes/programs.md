# Programs

- `main` is first fn to run in every program
- `println!`: the `!` means this is a macro rather than a fn.
- `rustc` rust compiler. Takes name of rust file as first arg
- compiled ahead of time as a separate step, rather than at same time (e.g. python)
- Prelude - list of auto-imported stuff for each program. See https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html
- programs are a _binary crates_, which are executable.
